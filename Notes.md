This is the tips I 
#### 2. Make sure all necessary libraries are listed in

### Potential Obstacles And Solutions
Here is a list of problems I faced during coding under local python and during Cloud Functions & Cloud Scheduler construction under GCP and actions I took to solve them.
#### Coding Construction in Python
* Master:
* Feature:
* Bugfix:
* etc...
#### Cloud Functions Creation in GCP
##### 1. Fail to pass the test run?
* Check if all necessary libraries are listed in the requirements.txt
* Make sure codes in main.py works well firstly under local environment and nothing wrong with the code
* Check if the "Entry point" is the first function/step your whole coding starts with
* Specifically under the example case, within the requirements.txt,
